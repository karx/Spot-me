# Day 1 Plan
Day 1 plan for Spot Me Design Sprint

## Step 0: Init
* Create a checklist
* Explaining the Sprint

## Step 1: Pre Work - The List
* We have created a list of all features, our thoughts of the product in an Ideallistic setting.  
These notes are the Long Term Goal/Vision of the product.

* We also enumerate all the problems, questions that we can anticipate or imagine.   
All things that can go wrong, the devils advocate.

## Step 2: Make a Map
Based on our shared understaning, we create a Flowchart/User flow of this product being used.

## We take a 10 min Break
Breaks are important. 

## Step 3: Expert Interviews
The actual interview would be not part of our call.    
* We can shortlist the expert we want to interview 
* come up with a small questionare.
* also try and schedule this meeting with the expert

## Step 4: How Might we
The opportunistic look at the whole scene. 
* Explain the How Might We notes
* We re-iterate over the Lists and our map, and each make `How Might We` notes to get the hang of it.
* These notes are to be taken by the team while we have Expert Interviews. (Please make loads of them)

## Step 5: Pick a target
* Most important customer
* One Target Moment in the map

## End: Prep for Week 2
Research existing solutions
